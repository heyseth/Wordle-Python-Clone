# Wordle-Python-Clone

This is a simple implementation of the popular Wordle word guessing game in Python. It requires no external libraries and runs in the console. The game has the full functionality of the original Wordle including proper handling of duplicate letters in both the input and the secret word.

The code is extensively commented and may be a useful project to study for someone new to Python or programming in general.
